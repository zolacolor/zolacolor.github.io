				A <i>better</i> birthday holiday?
			</h2>
			<p>
				If I know anything, it's that Florence likes horse riding. It's also been a while since she's been horse riding.
			</p>
			<p>
				Many places come to mind when one considers horse riding, or horse trekking. Mongolia, South East Asia, maybe even New Zealand. Yet a hidden gem exists placed squarely on the former Silk Road.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sweeping plains, massive waterfalls, mountain passes, canyons, meandering rivers, all adorn the varied landscapes of this landlocked country. But this is no Switzerland! Secluded 5500km from London this is no weekend getaway. This is real adventure.

			<h2>
				Welcome to Kyrgyzstan.
			</h2>
			<h4>
				Day 1
			</h4>
			<p>
				An approximate plan, we would fly through Istanbul to Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. After settling down, we can enjoy a walk through the iconic ex-Soviet architecture.
			</p>
			<h4>
				Day 2 - 6
			</h4>
			<p>
				We will spend between 4-6 hours a day on horseback, trekking through the various landscapes around Bishkek and beyond. Our guide will take us to settlements, yurts, and other remote outposts. The people of Kyrgyzstan are known for their horse riding prowess, and are accustomed to showing useless tourists how to ride. Edward will be safe!
			</p>
			<h4>
				Day 7
			</h4>
			<p>
				As we prepare for our departure, we can continue to explore Bishkek, or go on a day hike if the taste of nature remains strong!
			</p>

				I hope you have a lovely 22nd birthday. Once we find a date (a week or so) to book this, I'll get moving. Visas and flights are fairly stable, I'm contacting guides to find out when to book the trek. Horse riding tends to take place from June to September, so this may materialise closer to your next birthday than this one!
