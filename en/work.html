				How to bring digital to Parliament?
			</p>
			<p>
				In a broad role, I planned and delivered work for two general elections, a cyber attack, three large-scale rollouts, and our COVID-19 response.
			</p>
			<p>
				Delivering a multi-channel cyber security campaign, I drafted and delivered comms, commissioned work, and met with senior staff and the Speaker to discuss our work.
			</p>
			<p>
				As part of the campaign, I gave a persona to 'Cyber Guy', our character who embodies <a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2020/02/uk-parliament-faces-cyber-attacks-every-minute-of-every-day/" target="_blank">Parliament's persistant cyber threat</a>, brought to life through image and <a href="https://youtu.be/PUKvh8xrCrk" target="_blank">video</a>.

			<p>
				Leading on engagement for Parliament's new website, I built an engagement strategy which delivered a year-long plan to introduce parliament to our development work.
			</p>
			<p>
				I piloted organisation-wide show and tells, live-streaming these to our audience. A first in Parliament, my passion for video made this a success, with many teams after my expertise.
			</p>
			<p>
				I take pride in my work, and an active interest in Parliament. From attending <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker%27s_Lectures" target="_blank">every Speaker's lecture since joining</a>, chatting to Lords, to visiting Strangers (the gallery and the bar), I have made the most of being in Parliament.
